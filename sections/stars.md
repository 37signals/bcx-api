Stars
=====

Starring a project has its own API because people who donâ€™t have permission to change a project can still star it.

Note: Stars are included in project JSON as the `starred` attribute.


Star a project
--------------

* `POST /projects/123/star.json` stars the project.

No request body is required. Expect a `201 Created` response with an empty body.


Unstar a project
----------------

* `DELETE /projects/123/star.json` removes the star from the project.

Expect a `204 No Content` response.


List all stars
--------------

* `GET /stars.json` lists stars on active projects.

Expect a `200 OK` response with the JSON collection of starred project IDs, creation timestamps, and star URLs.
